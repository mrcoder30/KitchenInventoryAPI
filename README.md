Why are we doing this?
Aim of project was to build a fully functioning CRUD backend api built with Springboot.
I have chosen to build a kitchen inventory tracker to help me keep track of whats in my cupboards at home. 
This project was also final project of QA skills bootcamp.
How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the project to be challenging as I had started java 3 weeks ago as part of the intensive course. I found the features of spring boot very appealing and look forward to building out this project with extra functionality. I was only able to get my project up to MVP standard and will be expanding over the next weeks/months aswell as further devleoping my skillset with extra projects.
What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I found testing to be the most challenging and would have liked to have more time dedicated to that. 
The crud functionality went very well and was able to build out those features quickly.
Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
My advice for the project for future bootcampers would be:
1) to start java much earlier in the course.
2) change teaching format to lecture/seminar/workshop. concise lectures recordered that way it is easier to revise topics. It was very challenging to go back through the unsorted and unnamed recordings to find information required.
3) there should be weekly projects set with dedicated walkthrough and seminars to discuss so that students can gain relevant skills and practise prior to final project week.
